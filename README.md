# game_theory_altruism
Project for game theory course: "Is altruism evolutionary stable?"

Variation 5 runs the algorithm relevant to sections 3.6-3.8
Relevant parameters that need to be selected in variation 5.py:

Rational: "True" or "False"
Reproduction method: "payoff" or "utility"
Reciprocal: "True" or "False"

Other files similar to those in master branch, with changes made to accomodate the above methods.
